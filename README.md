This is the website for La Puerta Hostels, a Colombian hotel business. All
content is controlled via a custom-tailored CMS based on
[Payload CMS](https://payloadcms.com/). The frontend is powered by the
[React Router framework (formerly Remix)](https://reactrouter.com).

Besides the root brand, each hotel location has its own specific sub-brand. The
website reflects this by transitioning between themes when navigating from a
page of one brand to a page of another brand.
